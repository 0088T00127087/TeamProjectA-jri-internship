As of 12/08:
Requirements - 
	Manager Dashboard Data Display (currently nothing).
	Large scale UI display upgrade.
	Email confirmation, ensure all instances captured.
	"Log for informal chat" option to be implemented.
	Unit tests.


As of 12/06:

ProjectA (Backend) connected to database.
frontend set up.

When server is set up locally, and both of these projects are installed, should have the option to add both projects to the server.
	To clarify if it's functioning as expected:
		frontend -- http://localhost:8080/frontend/pages/index.html
		backend -- http://localhost:8080/ProjectA/api/getAllUsers
		
If you wish to update frontend:
files located @ frontend/src/main/webapp

"frontend" & "ProjectA" project naming to be finalised.
