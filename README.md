# TeamProjectA-jri-internship

As of 12/06:

ProjectA (Backend) connected to database.
frontend set up.

When server is set up locally, and both of these projects are installed, should have the option to add both projects to the server.
	To clarify if it's functioning as expected:
		frontend -- http://localhost:8080/frontend/pages/welcome.jsp
		backend -- http://localhost:8080/ProjectA/api/getAllUsers
		
If you wish to update frontend:
files located @ frontend/src/main/webapp

"frontend" & "ProjectA" project naming to be finalised.
